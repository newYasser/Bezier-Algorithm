## Introduction

This project provides a C++ implementation for drawing Bezier curves using the Windows API. Bezier curves are widely used in computer graphics and design applications for creating smooth and curved shapes. This code demonstrates how to create and render Bezier curves using Hermite interpolation.

## Features

- Drawing Bezier curves using Hermite interpolation.
- Simple and intuitive user interface to specify control points.
- Smooth rendering of Bezier curves on a Windows window.

## Prerequisites

Before using this code, make sure you have the following:

- Windows operating system.
- C++ compiler (e.g., Visual Studio, MinGW) installed.
- Basic understanding of C++ programming and Windows API.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the project repository from GitHub.
2. Open the project in your preferred C++ development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. Build the project to generate the executable file.

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Click the left mouse button to specify the control points of the Bezier curve. You need to select four control points to form a complete curve.
3. Once four control points are selected, the application will render the Bezier curve using the specified control points.
4. Repeat the above steps to create and render multiple Bezier curves.
